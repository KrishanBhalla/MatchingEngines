# MatchingEngines
A project to write matching engines, potentially in multiple languages

### Python

A simple, single threaded matching engine. For each instrument an OrderBook is created and orders are matched internally.
Mutability is leaned on heavily here.

TODO: Write unit tests, write performance tests, add close / amend functionality.
